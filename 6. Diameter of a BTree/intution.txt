1. Why DFS:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Coz here we need to move from root till leaf and calc for both halfes {left part and right part}

2. DS used: 
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Stack {in recurion}, nonlocal variable dia {for storing the diameter}

3. Variation:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ The code is same as for calculating height {just we have to do 1 extra step of calc. diameter whenever we are ready with the left and right heights}
