1. Why DFS:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Coz here we need to move from root till leaf and check for both half {left part and right part}

2. DS used: 
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Stack {in recurion}

3. Variation:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ We have to calc the height for each & every node {not only for root node}. Hence recursive calls with 'and' logical operator.
