1. Why DFS:
    |
    Coz here we need to move from root till leaf

2. DS used: 
    |
    (a) Stack {in recurion}, index {for current keeping a track of curr ind}

3. Variation:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ In every call, increase the index
    ðŸ‘‰ Breakinf condn is when we reach to the end of the array and the root also has no further nodes
