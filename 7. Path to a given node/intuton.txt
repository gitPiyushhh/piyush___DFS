1. Why DFS:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Coz here we need to move from root till leaf and check for both half {left part and right part}

2. DS used: 
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ Stack {in recurion}, ds {an array to store the path}

3. Variation:
    |
    ðŸ‘‰ There are 2 cndn of returning True and False {one in the retursive call step & one i the backtracking step}, remember those are important for maintaining the recursive call stack
    ðŸ‘‰ Backtracking step: If we cant find the right path till the leaf then we pop() and backtrack to the previous state{path}
